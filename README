This is my toolbox. I use it to collect scripts that help me do my job. Use them responsibly. If you destroy your own system, it is your responsibility.

bandwidth-limiter
===================
This script is used to turn on/turn off bandwidth limitations on a box using ipfw. This is useful for testing certain web application
such as reproducing timeouts and making sure the app works at slow speeds.

Because ipfw interacts with the kernel, you will probably have to run it as root, or run it using sudo.

sudo ./bandwidth-limiter --start
sudo ./bandwidth-limiter --list
sudo ./bandwidth-limiter --stop
